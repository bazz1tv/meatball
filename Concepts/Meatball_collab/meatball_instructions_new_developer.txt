I will give you the correct instructions to successfully install your future
work fun base :) a.k.a Meatball SVN Repo

Let's continue!!

BEGIN PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIoNS!!!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 1) Run copied installation files you got from my USB. 
  . Direct X
  . Tortoise SVN
  . Boost 
  . Memory Leak detector! https://vld.codeplex.com/

2) Get Dream Spark (see operator)
  . Visual Studio 2013
  . install takes awhile so do it before the next meeting
 
3) Checkout SVN Repo

  . Download meatball by right clicking on the desktop, or in the desired folder where you want to download 
  Meatball to, and click "SVN Checkout." This is an option now because TortoiseSVN is installed. 

  A window will come up asking for the address, use this:
  svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/meatball/code/trunk meatball-code

  In this same window, you can also name the folder that will be created, defaults to "code." Call it Meatball.

  Click OK and everything should download just fine :) 

4) Prepare environment variables 
 This is a step I forgot to inform you of, and Meatball will not install without doing this. We should meet ASAP and I can help you do this, and we will write a batch script to do it automatically for us in the future. For us, and for future developers on Windows. :) 

That means you cannot continue!! Please wait until we meet again!!! For completeness, I include step 5! BUT WAIT. IF You Have got the balls to continue, I present to you a challenge!! If you succeed, you will be able to forge onwards to step 5!! The golden gate!! <3 
CHALLENGE STAGE
  . Setting up environment variables for Meatball Code Compilation

In this challenge stage, you will google your way to discover setting up environment variables for your system. You will need to add 2 new system environment variables!! That's right! 2 NEW SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT Variables!! OK! 

You must name these 2 variables with the following contents: 
MEATBALL_LIBDIR -- this must be filled with the location of your new Meatball SVN repo which you recently downloaded with tortoiseSVN. :) 

BOOST_DIR = the install path of Boost. Check C:\local for starters.. that's the default path. 

If you've done that you can actually DO IT! You're a champion!! If not, GIVE IT TIME :) 
-----

5) Now you have meatball. It's time to compile. Navigate to Meatball/src/MSVC, and open the Meatball.sln file. 
This will open Visual Studio, from there, try to build Meatball. Remember that I warned you against the perils of "build solution." try to just "build" or "build project" ;) 

After that, you can run from within Visual Studio, or alternatively navigate to meatball root directory / Bin / and run the exectutable Meatball.exe. Have fun :) See you next week :D !!!! 

Sincerely,
