The ways the game is played across all the different input methods. The three targeted inputs are the super nintendo controller, touch screens, and mouse and keyboard.

Buttons:
* Directional Pad. Four cardinal directions. Can be combined for eight total directions.
	- Up = Aim up
	- Down = Nothing
	- Left = Move left
	- Right = Move right
	( Double tap to run )
	( ability to shoot forwards while moving backwards)
		if the player is holding the shoot button 
		down then the direction of the player is locked

	- X = ???
