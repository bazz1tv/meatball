Notes on Compiling SDL2_Mixer
---------------------------------

ON MSVC
-------
SMPEG doesn't work since it's still configured for SDL1.2

However, it's still included in the project...

All you have to do is go into the project properties and change the preprocessor definitions
Take out MP3_MUSIC or whatever alike definition is in there.

Then it should compile just fine
