This special note tells me to stay away from Boost 1.52

Let's work with 1.51 (like I have on my machine)

I use http://www.boostpro.com/download/

This is convenient, they have 1.51 anyways as their latest build. and in both 64bit and 32 bit formats.

I am running a 32 windows. so i get the 32 bit version

Get the BoostPro_1.51.0 Installer.

You will only need to install minimal components, that is
System and FileSystem.

Although I am really debating completely not using Boost at all and simply writing my own Directory Traversal functions.
Anyways get the static and dynamic release and debugging versions of those 2 libraries.

That's it.. you need to add a BOOST_DIR environment variable to your Environment Variables...
mine is Set to C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_51

You add this so that Meatball Project automatically uses it. So it actually makes your life easier :) 
Environment Variables FTW!
