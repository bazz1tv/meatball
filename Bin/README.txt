Issues Running Meatball |
-------------------------
If you get any strange errors running Meatball. Please report them to mbazzinotti@gmail.com
Optionally, you can try to resolve the issue by going to the "Optional" Folder and double clicking INSTALL.bat
Run INSTALL.bat -> This will install the Runtime libraries you need if you do not already have MSVC++ 2008.
I have done my best to ensure you don't need to install these libraries. But this is still in the test phase. So try
installing them yourself and see if that helps. If not, I STRONGLY encourage you to email me : mbazzinotti@gmail.com
